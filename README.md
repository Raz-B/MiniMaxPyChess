**Special thanks to [Niklasf](https://github.com/niklasf) and all who took part in the project [python-chess](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess).
I took [engine.py](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess/blob/master/chess/engine.py) from said project that does move generation using the bitboards technique and modified it into `chess_logic.py` for this project.**
